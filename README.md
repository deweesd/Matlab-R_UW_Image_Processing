# Matlab_CEUS_Features

Here are scripts generated via Matlab 2018a that consist of analyzing characteristics from high intensity ultrasound image processing using an injured spinal cord model. 

There are three scripts that correspond to various features of interest. Firstly, arrival time is a parameter that is calculuated using the 
time_delay_plus_peaktime function script. This function is based off of a curve_fit function that I use to extract adjusted y-fit values given x (i.e., timepoints).

The last script is compiling the raw values given a select region on the spinal cord of arrival times and generate a parameteric heatmap. Reference the attached .png files.
