# CEUS Features

For this repository I compiled some output data I gathered while working with contrast-enhanced ultrasound images at the University of Washington. Figure, scripts, and visual dictionaries are present in their respected folders.

All algorithms used for image processing was generated via Matlab 2018a which consisted of analyzing bolus kinetics and the changes that occurs while using a injured spinal cord model.
