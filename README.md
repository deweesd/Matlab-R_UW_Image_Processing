# CEUS Features

For this repository I compiled some output data I gathered while working with contrast-enhanced ultrasound images at the University of Washington. Figure, scripts, and visual dictionaries are present in their respected folders.

All algorithms used for image processing was generated via Matlab 2018a which consisted of analyzing bolus kinetics and the changes that occurs while using a injured spinal cord model. 


## TIC_Analysis folder info:

This folder consists of output figures that help illustrate how each Time Intensity Curve (TIC) parameter is extracted. Please reference the 'TIC_Features.png' file as well as the 'Arrival_Time_ex.png' file to see how each threshold is set and each feature is extracted to generate the parametric maps found in the folder ''Heatmap_dictionary''. The heatmap dictionary shows the differnce between two injury severity types at three distinct time points of either before, immediately after, or 10-weeks post injury.


## Scripts folder info:

This folder consits of the scripts I generated that not only walk through how each frame is iterated through and anlyzed given regions of interest and measuring signal intensity but also demonstrates of each parametric heatmap is created, first with non-blended images and then the blend and overlay process. Reference comments for each script for further info on the throught process used.
